## Prerequisities

Create "outputs" directory in the root directory if not created automatically. Also, you must install the following prerequisites:

* [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/)

## Run

* git clone https://github.com/regicsf2010/lattes_download.git
* cd lattes_download
* open Pycharm IDE on main.py


```diff
- Please note that this robot will search for a directory called 'outputs'. Each curriculum will be placed in this named directory. Thus, do not forget to create it.
```

## Instructions for Windows O.S.
* In the 'main.py', please change 'path_to_download' variable to use symbol '\' instead of '/'
* Also, add the following line to the option object: 'options.binary_location = r'C:\<path_to_firefox>\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe'
* Install ffmpeg and add '<path_to_ffmpeg>\bin' folder to the Environment Variables
